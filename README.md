# LLM Playground

Explore, experiment, and learn with Large Language Models (LLMs)!

## About

The LLM Playground is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help you dive into the exciting world of Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced practitioner seeking to experiment with new techniques, this repository has something for everyone.

## Motivation

This playground was created out of a passion for exploring the vast potential of LLMs. We believe that by making these models more accessible and providing hands-on examples, we can empower more people to harness their capabilities and contribute to this rapidly evolving field.

## Target Audience

This repository is suitable for anyone interested in LLMs, from beginners to experienced practitioners and researchers. The notebooks are designed to be self-explanatory and easy to follow, with clear explanations and code examples.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone [repository url]`
2. **Set up your environment:** 
    - Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed.
    - Install the required libraries: `pip install torch transformers datasets evaluate`
3. **Quick Start:** Try out a basic example in the `notebooks/LLMs/hello_world_llm.ipynb` notebook.
4. **Explore:** Browse the notebooks and scripts in different folders to find topics that interest you.
5. **Experiment:** Run the notebooks in your own environment (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook) and modify them to experiment with different parameters and techniques.
